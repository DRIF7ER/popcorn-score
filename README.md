<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Popcorn Score

## üé® Overview:
For our first paired project in Mod3 at Turing, we were assigned to create something like `Rotten Tomatoes`. An application that would allow the user to see all the movies when they visit the page. It allows them to search for a movie, they can click on the poster of the movie to be directed to the details page. The details page allowed the user to see the run time of a movie, the budget, an overview, the revenue, and the genre. They also had the ability to see clips and videos from Youtube. 

## üîç Preview of App:

## üå± Learning Goals:
Understand React‚Äôs key concepts such as components, state, props, and the component lifecycle. Use cypress to verify that components render correctly and respond to user interactions. Use a routing library like `react-router-dom` to manage navigation in your React application.

## üèÜ Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
- We wanted to create a carousel for the landing page of our application, we did research and found a couple that looked great. But instead of installing a package to get a carousel, we created one.  
- Creating a better way to display the movie information in-front of the movie poster. 

Challenges:
- We both agree cypress testing can be challenging, It was a rough start but we started to get a hand on it as we went on.
